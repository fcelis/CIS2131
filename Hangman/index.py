Project Description: This script implements a classic game of Hangman.
The game randomly selects a word, and the player must guess the word one letter at a time.
The player has a total of six attempts to guess the correct word before the stick figure is fully drawn
and the game is lost. Each incorrect guess brings the player closer to defeat, while correct guesses
reveal letters in the word. The game continues until the player either successfully guesses
the word or runs out of attempts.
