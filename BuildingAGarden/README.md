### Garden Planning and Cost Estimation

**Objective:**  
Create a Python program that helps users plan and estimate the cost of building a garden with various types of plants.

---

#### **Project Requirements:**

1. **User Input for Garden Dimensions:****e Plants and Costs:**
    
    - Present a list of available plants along with their respective costs per square foot, such as:
        - Roses: $2.50 per square foot
        - Tulips: $1.75 per square foot
        - Daisies: $1.00 per square foot
2. **Calculate Total Area and Cost for Each Plant:**
    
    - Ask the user how much of the garden they want to dedicate to each type of plant.
    - Ensure the total area allocated to plants does not exceed the garden's dimensions. If it does, display an error message and prompt the user to enter a valid area.
3. **Display Results:**
    
    - Show the total area and cost for each type of plant.
    - Calculate and display the grand total cost for the entire garden project.
4. **Error Handling:**
    
    - Include checks to ensure users cannot allocate more space to plants than is available in their garden.

#### **Project Steps:**

1. **Gather Garden Dimensions:**
    
    - Ask the user to enter the garden's length and width to calculate the total available area in square feet.
2. **Plant Selection and Area Allocation:**
    
    - Display a list of available plants and their costs.
    - Ask the user to input the area they wish to allocate to each type of plant, ensuring it does not exceed the total garden area.
3. **Calculate Costs:**
    
    - For each plant, calculate the area allocated and the total cost based on the plant's cost per square foot.
4. **Output:**
    
    - Display the area and cost for each plant.
    - Show the grand total cost for the entire garden.
5. **Deliverables:**
    
    - Submit the Python program file (.py) and include a screenshot showing the program's output.
